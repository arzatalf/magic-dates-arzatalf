# Magic-Dates
A challenge program for CSI

June 10, 1960 is a special date, because when written as 6/10/60, the month times the date equals the year.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a month, a day, and a year(each in numeric form). The program should then decide if the month times the day equals the year. If so, notify the user. If not, notify the user that the date is not magic.
